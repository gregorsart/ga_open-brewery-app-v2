# Thoughts before starting the project

10.12.2023 // gregorsart

## General Thoughts

### Tech Stack

- Vercel next.js
- Vercel swr
- Tailwind with next.js

### Design

- How does the API Data look like, what do I want to render in which form?
- mobile first approach
- Tailwind with configuration of the tailwind config
- Colors traditional brewing colors (yellow and brown) plus a fresh green
- Create an illustration maybe as a logo for the page

### Api

- How does the data look like (also important for the Design)

### Spikes

- Pagination (next and previous vs. load more button)
- Dynamic Roting for Detail Pages
- Next Skeleton

### Optional things

- Multiple Pages (About Page, List of Breweries + Brewery Detail Page)
- Hosting on Vercel maybe?

## Next Steps

1. Project Setup (locally)
2. Create Repo on Github (private)
3. Connect Github repo with local repo
4. Create feature branch like "feature/01basic-fetch

---

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
